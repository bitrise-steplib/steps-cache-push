title: "Bitrise.io Cache:Push"
summary: "Updates the Cache, if required"
description: |-
  This step checks whether the cache has to be updated (based on the
  `Cache Paths` and `Ignore Paths from change check` inputs).
  If it has to be updated, the step will create a new cache archive and upload it.

  It won't update/upload the cache if the cache did not change,
  nor in the case of Pull Request builds (unless you change the `run_if` property of the Step).

  For more information on setup and tips & tricks, check out our [Bitrise DevCenter guide](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/caching/about-caching/).

      title: "Cache paths"
      summary: Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.
      description: |-
        Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

        A path item can be either a file or a directory.

        You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
        syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
        *The indicator can only be a file!*

        If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
        this step to fail. It'll be logged but the step will try to gather
        as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print a warning
        about the invalid items.
  - ignore_check_on_paths:
    opts:
      title: "Ignore Paths from change check"
      summary: "Define the paths which have to be ignored when checking for cache changes."
      description: |-
        These paths will be ignored from change checking.
        If something has changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else has changed,
        then the cache won't be updated.

        **Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored from the cache archive**.
        If a path is located inside a specified Cache Path item and not prefixed with an `!`,
        it'll be included in the cache archive, but won't be checked for changes. 

        The path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`.
        `*` will replace a path element (for example, `a/*/b` will match `a/x/b`).
        `**` will replace part of a path (for example, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/z/b`).
        To exclude a full directory like `/my/full/path`, simply put a `/` behind `/my/full/path`,
        so it will be `/my/full/path/`.

        Important: you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
        For example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you
        can't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file from checking
        for a change and no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.
        You can ignore paths inside a Cache Path, however, if, for example, a path is `a/path/to/cache`, you can ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,
        unless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.

        The point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely
        ignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which
        can't be checked for updates,changes or fingerprints.

    opts:

      summary: Working directory path

        Working directory path - should be an absolute path.
  - fingerprint_method: "file-content-hash"
    opts:
      title: Fingerprint Method
      summary: Fingerprint method, used for checking file changes.
      description: |-
        The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
        fingerprints for the cached files.

        The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
        the cached files did change - if it changed, a new cache will be generated.
        If the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint, then
        no new cache will be generated.

        **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
        be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

        * File path
        * File size
        * File permission bits

        Information about the options:

        * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
          and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
          order to create the checksum hash!
        * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
          can be significantly faster, as the file doesn't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

        **Note**: in case of "update indicator files", the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
        regardless of which option you select here.

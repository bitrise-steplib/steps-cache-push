title: "Bitrise.io Cache:Push"
summary: "Updates the Cache, if required"
description: |-
  Checks whether cache has to be updated based on the **Cache Paths** and **Ignore Paths** inputs.
  If it does, the Step creates a new cache archive and uploads it. 
  It won't update/upload the cache if the cache hasn't changed nor in the case of a pull request unless you change the Step's `run_if` property. 
  For caching, you will need the **Bitrise.io Cache:Pull** Step at the beginning of your Workflow (after the **Git Clone Repository** Step but before a dependency installer Step) to download the previous cache, if any. 
  The **Bitrise.io Cache:Push** Step should be the very last Step in your Workflow.
  
  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Cache any directory or file by adding it in the **Cache paths** field. 
  If adding multiple paths, separate them with a newline.
  If you have a path in the list which does not exist, it will not cause the Step to fail. 
  You can also specify an update indicator file with the `->` syntax, for example, `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated.` 
  Please note the indicator points to a file and not to a folder.
  2. In the **Ignore Paths from change check** field, you can set any path which you don't want to do change analysis for.
  - Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored from the cache archive.
  - The path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`. 
  The `*` will replace a path element, the `**` will replace part of a path. 
  To exclude a full directory, simply put a `/` behind the directory.
  Note that you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
  3. Modify **Working directory** if you wish to set relative cache paths and reference them from a working directory other than `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`.
  4. Select a **Fingerprint Method** option (`file-content-hash` or `file-mod-time`) to detect changes in a directory, file, or update an indicator file. 
  If changes are detected, new cache gets generated.
  5. If you set **Debug mode?** input to `true`, the Step will print out more detailed logs.
  6. With **Compress cache?** input set to `true`, you can compress the cache archive for faster uploads and downloads, especially useful for node-modules and other huge dependency folders.
  7. In `Ignore paths collected by steps` you can set which files or extensions should be ignored by the Step during the build.
  8. `Cache Upload URL` shows the URL where the cache gets uploaded.
  
  ### Troubleshooting
  We recommend you do not cache any `package.lock`, `gemfile.lock`, `podfile.lock` but follow the dependency best practices instead.

        Cache these paths. Separate paths with a newline.

        A path item can be either a file or a directory.

        You can also specify an "update indicator file" with the `->`
        syntax: `update/this -> if/this/file/is/updated`.
        *The indicator can only be a file!*

        If you have a path in the list which doesn't exist that will not cause
        this step to fail. It'll be logged but the step will try to gather
        as many specified & valid paths as it can, and just print a warning
        about the invalid items.

    opts:
      title: "Ignore Paths from change check"
      summary: "Define the paths which have to be ignored when checking for cache changes."
      description: |-
        These paths will be ignored from change checking.
        If something has changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else has changed,
        then the cache won't be updated.

        **Paths prefixed with an `!` will get ignored from the cache archive**.
        If a path is located inside a specified Cache Path item and not prefixed with an `!`,
        it'll be included in the cache archive, but won't be checked for changes. 

        The path can also include `*`, `**`, `/`.
        `*` will replace a path element (for example, `a/*/b` will match `a/x/b`).
        `**` will replace part of a path (for example, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/z/b`).
        To exclude a full directory like `/my/full/path`, simply put a `/` behind `/my/full/path`,
        so it will be `/my/full/path/`.

        Important: you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
        For example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you
        can't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file from checking
        for a change and no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.
        You can ignore paths inside a Cache Path, however, if, for example, a path is `a/path/to/cache`, you can ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,
        unless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.

        The point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely
        ignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which
        can't be checked for updates,changes or fingerprints.

      summary: Fingerprint method, used for checking file changes.
      description: |-
        The specified Fingerprint Method will be used to calculate
        fingerprints for the cached files.

        The (file) fingerprint is used to check whether
        the cached files did change - if it changed, a new cache will be generated.
        If the fingerprint matches the previous cache version's fingerprint, then
        no new cache will be generated.

        **Regardless of which method you choose** the following file attributes will
        be used to create the fingerprint **in addition** to the method you choose:

        * File path
        * File size
        * File permission bits

        Information about the options:

        * `file-content-hash` : create a file content checksum hash for every file in the cache,
          and use that as the fingerprint source of the file. This means that **the full file content will be loaded** in
          order to create the checksum hash!
        * `file-mod-time` : use the file's "modified at" time information. For larger files this method
          can be significantly faster, as the file doesn't have to be loaded to calculate this information!

        **Note**: in case of "update indicator files", the fingerprint method will always be `file-content-hash`,
        regardless of which option you select here.
